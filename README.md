Requirement Analysis in Software Development
**What is Requirement Analysis?**
Requirement Analysis is a critical process in software development that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a system or project. It serves as the foundation for building software that meets user needs, aligns with business objectives, and adheres to technical and operational constraints. In the context of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), requirement analysis typically occurs in the initial phases (e.g., planning or requirements gathering) but influences every subsequent stage, from design to deployment and maintenance.
