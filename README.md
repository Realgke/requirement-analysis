Requirement Analysis in Software Development
**What is Requirement Analysis?**
Requirement Analysis is a critical process in software development that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a system or project. It serves as the foundation for building software that meets user needs, aligns with business objectives, and adheres to technical and operational constraints. In the context of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), requirement analysis typically occurs in the initial phases (e.g., planning or requirements gathering) but influences every subsequent stage, from design to deployment and maintenance.

**Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**
Requirement Analysis is crucial in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures that a software project is well-defined, aligned with stakeholder needs, and feasible within constraints

Ensures Alignment with Stakeholder Needs and Business Goals: Requirement Analysis captures and validates stakeholder expectations, ensuring the software delivers intended features 
Reduces Risks and Costs by Identifying Issues Early: By spotting ambiguities or conflicts upfront, it prevents costly rework, saving time and resourcesâ€”fixing issues early is 10-100 times cheaper than later in the SDLC.
Provides a Foundation for Development, Testing, and Maintenance:It creates a clear blueprint  guiding design, coding, testing, and updates, ensuring solutions like log analysis tools are purposeful, testable, and maintainable.
